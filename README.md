# JS-DOM-Practice
Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Practice Code

## Code Origins

The original code was made available for download from Udacity's Github repository as part of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.  The original code did not have a license, so there was no license for me to add to this repository.  Also, it should be noted that the code was provided for practicing coding, it does not necessarily represent how Udacity codes web pages.

All inquiries regarding the use of this code outside of educational purposes need to be directed to Udacity.

## For Educational Purposes

I will be editing the code made available for my own education and to help other Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree students whenever possible.
