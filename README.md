# JS-DOM-Practice
Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Practice Code

## Code Origins

The original code was made available for download from Udacity's Github repository as part of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.  The original code did not have a license, so there was no license for me to add to this repository.

All inquaries regarding the use of this code outside of educational purposes need to be directed to Udacity.

## For Educational Purposes

I will be editing the code made available for my own eduction and to help other Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree students whenever posible.
